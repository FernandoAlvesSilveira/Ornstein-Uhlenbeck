#Weather derivatives

Weather affects the economy in several ways. This algorithm proposes a simple model in R to estimate parameters and simulate a trajectory of weather indicators. Was 
follow a Alaton, Djehiche and Stillberger (2002) model to estimate trajectories of temperatures. However, the traditional pricing model (Black Scholes) is not 
being applicable to weather derivatives. In addition, was implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to price a European call and put option.
